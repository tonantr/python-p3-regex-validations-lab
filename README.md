# RegEx Validations Lab

## Learning Goals

- Validate that strings match specific patterns using regular expressions.
- Search for strings that match specific patterns using regular expressions.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Regular Expression**: a sequence of characters used to search for a pattern
inside of a string.
- **Pattern**: a description of sequences of characters that share certain
traits with one another. Sequences do not need to be the same length or share
any common characters to pattern match. Also called a **filter**...

## Instructions

This is a **test-driven lab**. Run `pipenv install` to create your virtual
environment and `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment. Then run
`pytest -x` to run your tests. Use these instructions and `pytest`'s error
messages to complete your work in `regex.py` in the `lib/` folder.

This lab is meant to give you experience with writing patterns for regular
expressions and using the `re` module to check your pattern against different
strings. Use [regex101][regex101] to test your pattern as you work through the
different strings.

- Run `pytest -x` to execute the first test. This will check your `name` RegEx
  against the string `"John Cena"`. This should be a match.
- Once you've compiled a regular expression that matches this first string,
  run `pytest -x` again to check against the next string in line.
- There will be several tests with valid names and invalid names. Your RegEx
  needs to discern between the two groups!
- Repeat this process with the `phone_number` and `email_address` RegExes.

Once all of your tests are passing, commit and push your work using `git` to
submit.

### Hints

Regular expressions can be confusing and frustrating. You'll only get used to
them with practice. That being said, there are some tools and tricks that will
help you our along the way:

- `\w` is shorthand for any word character: `[A-Za-z0-9_]`. `\W` is shorthand
  for anything outside of that range.
- Similarly to `\w`, `\S` will match any non-whitespace character- though it
  includes characters not found in words as well. `\s` matches any single
  whitespace character.
- Getting quotes, backslashes, and other operational characters into your regex
  requires that you lead with an escape character, the backslash (`\`).
- Ignoring a specific set of characters (say, 'c', 'h', 'a', 'r', 's') can be
  accomplished with square brackets and carrots (`^`): [^chars].
- Matching one pattern _or_ another with the same regex can be accomplished with
  the `|` operator: `r'hello|goodbye'`.
- [regex101][regex101] provides a "Quick Reference" section in the bottom right
  corner that is very helpful for more tips and tricks along the way.
